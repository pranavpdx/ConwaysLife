# Conway's Game of Life
This repository contains the code for the famous simulation of Conways game of life. This specific game is played
on a 17x17 gridd yet it works for any dimension. The code uses Jswing as its GUI source.

## Rules for simulation 
1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2.Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
